# Indeed_web_scrapping
This project is to scrap indeed and clean the data so that can be used for data analysis.

1) Scrap public proxies from https://free-proxy-list.net/ and save it as proxylist.csv (proxy_scrapping.py)
2) From the public proxy list sort out the proxies that can access to Indeed (proxy_cleaning.py)
3) Rotate the proxy list and scrap indeed job description (main.py)
4) clean the data and save to "job_data_cleaned.py" so that the data can be used for the analysis
