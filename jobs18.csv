We are the global leader in bot mitigation. Founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore, we’ve grown to protect more than 200 enterprises—including the largest internet platforms—from bot attacks by verifying the humanity of over a trillion (that’s 12 zeroes!) online interactions every day. State-of-the-art bots look and act like humans when they click on ads, visit websites, fill out forms, take over accounts, and commit payment fraud. We stop them.
We hope you’ll want to join our mission to stop bots, disrupt the economics of cyber crime, and keep it human.
DS@HUMANsec
The Detection team at HUMAN is the beating heart of our company - finding and stopping bots. We build the algorithms that run behind the scenes analysing and decisioning on our vast number of daily events. We deploy advanced statistical and machine learning models that need to be flexible for different deployment scenarios and robust to a fraudster’s favourite tactics: evasion and deception.
The human we need for this role will work on
BotGuard
: our product for cybersecurity and account protection. BotGuard provides real-time insight and security for customers fighting account takeover, account creation fraud, payment fraud, and content abuse.
What you will do:
Devise experimental and production techniques (supervised, unsupervised, statistical, and rule-based) which leverage the signals we collect from browser and in-app interactions to produce robust ‘bot markers’ for our product.
Gain a working understanding of application / account based threat models to best identify analytical approaches that will work.
Help the team counter ‘named attacks’, ongoing bot campaigns that we work to eliminate, by understanding how their operators adapt and identifying the weaknesses in their strategies that allow us to keep our markers accurate.
Be an active participant in team responsibilities, including reviewing other data scientist’s work prior to launching new detection rules/algorithms, our ‘sheriffing’ process where we proactively monitor anomalies arising in our systems and taking part in ‘tech-debt days’ to keep our codebase clean and healthy.
Collaborate with our product / commercial team to develop new data-intensive product features that will delight our customers.
Contribute to our growing DS toolsets, ‘creating tau’ by empowering the other humans around you.
Who you are:
You’ve worked as a data scientist solving large-scale data intensive problems in production systems (we process trillions of events per day, so literacy with large datasets is a must!).
You can explain the nuances of different modelling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers.
You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms (e.g. Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy etc).We don’t ask for specific prior domain experience. However, fraud detection requires identifying anomalies and abuse with minimal ground truth and cybersecurity work requires a savvy awareness of how the web works and how bad actors operate.
Be prepared to tell us why you think your experience sets you up well.
You’ve demonstrated that you’re self-driven by learning the skills you need to solve problems you’ve tackled in previous roles.
You almost certainly don’t have all the skills to thwart all the bots right now, so an appetite for growth is key.

We are the global leader in bot mitigation. Founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore, we’ve grown to protect more than 200 enterprises—including the largest internet platforms—from bot attacks by verifying the humanity of over a trillion (that’s 12 zeroes!) online interactions every day. State-of-the-art bots look and act like humans when they click on ads, visit websites, fill out forms, take over accounts, and commit payment fraud. We stop them.
We hope you’ll want to join our mission to stop bots, disrupt the economics of cyber crime, and keep it human.
DS@HUMANsec
The Detection team at HUMAN is the beating heart of our company - finding and stopping bots. We build the algorithms that run behind the scenes analysing and decisioning on our vast number of daily events. We deploy advanced statistical and machine learning models that need to be flexible for different deployment scenarios and robust to a fraudster’s favourite tactics: evasion and deception.
The human we need for this role will work on
BotGuard
: our product for cybersecurity and account protection. BotGuard provides real-time insight and security for customers fighting account takeover, account creation fraud, payment fraud, and content abuse.
What you will do:
Devise experimental and production techniques (supervised, unsupervised, statistical, and rule-based) which leverage the signals we collect from browser and in-app interactions to produce robust ‘bot markers’ for our product.
Gain a working understanding of application / account based threat models to best identify analytical approaches that will work.
Help the team counter ‘named attacks’, ongoing bot campaigns that we work to eliminate, by understanding how their operators adapt and identifying the weaknesses in their strategies that allow us to keep our markers accurate.
Be an active participant in team responsibilities, including reviewing other data scientist’s work prior to launching new detection rules/algorithms, our ‘sheriffing’ process where we proactively monitor anomalies arising in our systems and taking part in ‘tech-debt days’ to keep our codebase clean and healthy.
Collaborate with our product / commercial team to develop new data-intensive product features that will delight our customers.
Contribute to our growing DS toolsets, ‘creating tau’ by empowering the other humans around you.
Who you are:
You’ve worked as a data scientist solving large-scale data intensive problems in production systems (we process trillions of events per day, so literacy with large datasets is a must!).
You can explain the nuances of different modelling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers.
You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms (e.g. Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy etc).We don’t ask for specific prior domain experience. However, fraud detection requires identifying anomalies and abuse with minimal ground truth and cybersecurity work requires a savvy awareness of how the web works and how bad actors operate.
Be prepared to tell us why you think your experience sets you up well.
You’ve demonstrated that you’re self-driven by learning the skills you need to solve problems you’ve tackled in previous roles.
You almost certainly don’t have all the skills to thwart all the bots right now, so an appetite for growth is key.

More about Mission Lane:
Mission Lane is based in the U.S., with offices in Richmond, Virginia & San Francisco, California. Founded in December 2018, we've rapidly grown to over 1 million customers.
It all started with a realization: nearly fifty percent of the adult population in the U.S. doesn't have access to a clear line of credit. And by ""clear"" we mean credit without crazy fees that only increase debt. Most traditional credit card companies either overlook or overcharge this group because they have less-than-prime credit scores or no score at all. We decided this just wouldn't do.
We understand that everyone doesn't have the same opportunities. We also know that everyone joins us at different stages of their financial journeys. Providing access to clear credit was a critical first step, but our work isn't done. We are actively developing new products designed to meet our customers where they are, according to their needs.
We get it -
life happens
. That's why Mission Lane is hard at work paving a better way forward.
Just like for our customers, Mission Lane creates opportunities for our employees to learn, grow, and prosper. We strive to create an environment that brings out the best in everyone, everyday.

281,Data Scientist,Nautilus Labs,,"Hybrid remote in New York, NY",,"About Nautilus.
Nautilus is building artificial intelligence to advance the efficiency of ocean commerce. We deliver technology to help shipping companies minimize fuel consumption, maximize operational efficiency, and optimize fleet performance. By arming ship owners and operators with real-time predictive decision support, Nautilus is reducing greenhouse gas emissions and making global trade sustainable.
Ocean shipping consumes over $100 billion dollars of fuel every year, and up to 30% of it can be saved. For owner-operators, reliance on manually collected and analyzed data makes it difficult to optimize fleet performance in real-time. By providing a unified data platform that leverages machine learning, Nautilus helps its clients make better decisions to maximize the return on each ship and every voyage. For our clients, this means they drive closer collaboration, greater transparency, and stronger accountability across their global teams every day.
About you.
We are hiring a Data Scientist to join the Nautilus Labs team. You are inquisitive and enjoy exploring new research questions, and are capable of working largely independently. You have a strong foundation in statistical thinking and machine learning, with a background in data science, statistics, computer science, physics, naval architecture, mechanical engineering, or a related quantitative field. You have experience conducting technical investigations and building models with real-world data, and are able to collaborate with and communicate findings clearly with colleagues across the organization. You are comfortable building and evaluating regression models, and have experience with or interest in some combination of outlier detection, optimization methods, Bayesian methods for data analysis and modeling, model training and deployment, and cloud-based ML tooling. Familiarity with maritime, oceanographic, and meteorological data is a plus.
Regardless of whether your primary strengths and interests lie more in statistics, data investigations and research, or machine learning and MLOps, you’re interested in contributing to the full data science life-cycle: problem development and exploration; model implementation and deployment; and model applications to drive insights and client value.
Outcomes for this role.
In this role, you will be responsible for working with maritime ship and weather data to detect trends and develop or improve predictive models. You will work closely with other data scientists, data analysts, and software engineers to build, test, and deploy robust ship performance models. You will partner with our product team to help conceptualize, design, and implement new machine learning-based products. While we are a collaborative team, you will also be expected to take independent ownership of specific research and development projects. Your work will help drive product development throughout the Nautilus team, and support better client decision-making to help meet their fuel efficiency and sustainability goals.
Proficiencies.
2+ years of professional experience and/or an advanced degree, with a background in data science, statistics, computer science, physics, naval architecture, mechanical engineering, or another related quantitative field.
Strong analytical skills and knowledge of the technical and statistical underpinning of typical data science methods.
Proficiency with the Python data science stack is required; SQL, R or other data analysis languages are also valuable.
Experience conducting technical investigations and modeling with real-world data.
Collaborative with strong communication skills.
Deep experience with regression modeling and supervised learning methods.
Some combination of experience with outlier detection, optimization methods, Bayesian methods for data analysis and modeling, cloud-based ML-tooling, and MLOps best practices (note: expertise across all these areas is not expected or required)
Nice to have: Familiarity or interest in maritime, oceanographic, and meteorological data is a plus, as is experience working with and modeling physical systems.
Our core values.
Get ready to join a group of diverse, smart, talented, and driven individuals. We are looking for people who are motivated by environmentalism and a future where shipping is sustainable and safe. A team member joining Nautilus is...
We’re THOUGHTFUL, with a bias towards action.
We’re an INCLUSIVE crew, and we are not passengers along for the ride.
We’re DIRECT and we ask the tough questions.
We EMPATHIZE with humanity.
Location.
You may join as a Remote Crew Member, or as a member of the NYC Hub. In the NYC Hub, we expect to be in the office 2 days a week, beginning in March 2022. We are currently hiring in Eastern and Central timezones.
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status."

852,Data Scientist,Finrise,,"Burlingame, CA",,"Who you are
The first Data Scientist at Finrise will play an imperative role in enabling patient financing for out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. You recognize that 56% of Americans with a less than ideal FICO Score need new ways to evaluate creditworthiness in efficient and holistic ways.

You understand that the ultimate measurement of success is enabling patients to afford care in a time of need, with a fair rate, in terms they understand. At the end of the day, you want to change the way credit is evaluated.
What you'll be doing
Designing and developing core machine learning infrastructure
Conducting statistical analyses to assess the value of new data points and vendors
Building and deploying production risk models to improve Finrise patient underwriting

This role can be based our of our offices in New York, NY, Atlanta, GA, or be fully remote (US Only).
Your Mandate
Identify any and all opportunities to better leverage data to inform strategy.
Build and maintain core reporting for the company.
Deliver analyses needed to make better decisions in marketing, product development, and business strategy.
Set the foundation for a scaled data operation with more (future) specialization in each domain (e.g. marketing).

A deep interest in how our business works, how decisions get made, and how data could help improve the quality of those decisions
Experience using the tools and techniques of “modern data stacks”
Dashboarding and business intelligence (e.g. Looker, Tableau, Mode, etc.)
Data warehousing (e.g. BigQuery, Snowflake, RedShift, etc.)
Transformation and modeling (e.g. dbt)

A data modeling interview with an engineer
A stakeholder alignment interview to assess cross-functional communication
A conversation with our founder, Josh Schwadron
Please note: we have this role posted under a few different titles as there is not universal alignment on titles in the data world. In the interest of transparency, here is how we think about the nuances of titles with regard to this role:
Analytics Engineer: this best captures a need for technical rigor; however, it may not clearly stress the importance of finding someone with a very strong business sense.
Data Analyst: this is perhaps the most “accurate,” but it may not articulate the technical requirements; we also fear there may be a stigma against this title as “data scientist” may appeal to more people.
Data Scientist: this is most likely resonant with the market, but will likely generate the most noise as it has become a pretty large bucket of different skills and interests.
This article (https://www.abartholomew.com/writing/your-first-data-hire), written by Andrew Bartholomew, summarizes how we are thinking about this role.

Identify any and all opportunities to better leverage data to inform strategy.
Build and maintain core reporting for the company.
Deliver analyses needed to make better decisions in marketing, product development, and business strategy.

A data modeling interview with an engineer
A stakeholder alignment interview to assess cross-functional communication
A conversation with our founder, Josh Schwadron
Please note: we have this role posted under a few different titles as there is not universal alignment on titles in the data world. In the interest of transparency, here is how we think about the nuances of titles with regard to this role:
Analytics Engineer: this best captures a need for technical rigor; however, it may not clearly stress the importance of finding someone with a very strong business sense.
Data Analyst: this is perhaps the most “accurate,” but it may not articulate the technical requirements; we also fear there may be a stigma against this title as “data scientist” may appeal to more people.
Data Scientist: this is most likely resonant with the market, but will likely generate the most noise as it has become a pretty large bucket of different skills and interests.
This article (https://www.abartholomew.com/writing/your-first-data-hire), written by Andrew Bartholomew, summarizes how we are thinking about this role.

)
An analytical interview to assess ability to identify business drivers and represent them with data and charts
A data modeling interview with an engineer
A stakeholder alignment interview to assess cross-functional communication
A conversation with our founder, Josh Schwadron
Please note: we have this role posted under a few different titles as there is not universal alignment on titles in the data world. In the interest of transparency, here is how we think about the nuances of titles with regard to this role:
Analytics Engineer: this best captures a need for technical rigor; however, it may not clearly stress the importance of finding someone with a very strong business sense.
Data Analyst: this is perhaps the most “accurate,” but it may not articulate the technical requirements; we also fear there may be a stigma against this title as “data scientist” may appeal to more people.
Data Scientist: this is most likely resonant with the market, but will likely generate the most noise as it has become a pretty large bucket of different skills and interests.
This article (https://www.abartholomew.com/writing/your-first-data-hire), written by Andrew Bartholomew, summarizes how we are thinking about this role.
Benefits:
Competitive compensation

Build and maintain core reporting for the company.
Deliver analyses needed to make better decisions in marketing, product development, and business strategy.

A data modeling interview with an engineer
A stakeholder alignment interview to assess cross-functional communication
A conversation with our founder, Josh Schwadron
Please note: we have this role posted under a few different titles as there is not universal alignment on titles in the data world. In the interest of transparency, here is how we think about the nuances of titles with regard to this role:
Analytics Engineer: this best captures a need for technical rigor; however, it may not clearly stress the importance of finding someone with a very strong business sense.
Data Analyst: this is perhaps the most “accurate,” but it may not articulate the technical requirements; we also fear there may be a stigma against this title as “data scientist” may appeal to more people.
Data Scientist: this is most likely resonant with the market, but will likely generate the most noise as it has become a pretty large bucket of different skills and interests.
This article (https://www.abartholomew.com/writing/your-first-data-hire), written by Andrew Bartholomew, summarizes how we are thinking about this role.

About LogRocket
LogRocket was founded in 2016 by Matthew Arbesfeld and Ben Edelstein, a computer science duo who have been building products together since the third grade. Frustrated by how difficult it was to understand their customers' experiences, Arbesfeld and Edelstein set out toward an audacious goal: to make every experience on the web as perfect as possible.
Our team is a diverse group that brings an eclectic set of experiences from Google, Meteor, Drift, HubSpot, MIT, and Columbia. We enjoy eating lunch together every day in our airy downtown Boston office, learning more about each other at our show-and-tell sessions, and hosting our friends during #logrocketeer events. We focus on building our software with care and craftsmanship — our engineering blog posts offer a taste of that — and we welcome talented people from all backgrounds. Many of us have important spaces in our lives, whether it be family, social organizations, schools, or former companies, and we're doing all we can to make LogRocket another one.
LogRocket is an equal-opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees."

Data is the future
Businesses create, receive, use and share vast volumes of data.
The data they hold contains more potential than they realise, or that most will likely ever access.
It is too inaccessible, invisible or inconsistent, restraining the potential to improve or innovate.
For data to tell its stories, it needs to be given a platform from which to speak and a voice and language that can be understood.
Calligo gives businesses renewed optimism for their use, control and understanding of data by reconstructing its entire lifecycle.
Calligo creates safe, performant, accessible and unified environments for all forms and sources of data, and reveals its insights throughout the business, sparking a culture of data-driven innovation and creativity.

Upstart is a leading AI lending platform partnering with banks and credit unions to expand access to affordable credit. As we transitioned to being a public company, we're now poised to leverage our domain expertise and revolutionize every aspect of lending and credit risk evaluation. We've recently expanded our offerings to include automobile refinancing and we plan to take on more verticals as the business grows.
By leveraging Upstart's AI platform, Upstart-powered banks and credit unions can have higher approval rates and lower loss rates, while simultaneously delivering the exceptional digital-first lending experience their customers demand. Upstart's patent-pending platform is the first to receive a no-action letter from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau related to fair lending. Upstart not only supports a large remote workforce, but also has offices in San Mateo, CA; Columbus, OH; and Austin, TX.
Most Upstarters join us because they connect with our mission of enabling access to effortless credit based on true risk. If you are energized by the impact you can make at Upstart, we'd love to hear from you!

Our Machine Learning team researches and productionizes all of Upstart's core predictive models. If data is the new oil, then you'll be responsible for the refining process that creates the most premium fuel possible. You'll work in an environment where actionable insights from data are valued and needed, so you'll be able to see your analysis turn into measurable results for our company and our borrowers.
