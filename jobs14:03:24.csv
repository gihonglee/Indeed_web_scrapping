59,Applied Data Scientist (Remote),Leaf Logistics,,"Remote in New York, NY",,"We are Leaf
Leaf is on a mission to upend the way companies buy and sell transportation. Every year, billions of dollars, hundreds of megatons of carbon and millions of person-hours are wasted because the companies who ship goods and the companies who carry them aren’t upfront about their needs and abilities. Our platform finds ways for buyers and sellers to contract binding commitments for plannable and predictable freight and allows those contracts to be traded when needs change. In time, Leaf will become the hub through which the trillion-dollar American freight market is managed.
We are a team of experienced, smart, and mildly disagreeable troublemakers who like taking on unreasonably big challenges; we know how to build things, we’ve lived what’s broken in this industry, and we’re looking for bright, ambitious people to help us drag the transportation world kicking and screaming into the 21st century.
What does an applied data scientist do at Leaf?
We ingest, clean and process large amounts of data from a variety of sources including shippers, carriers, 3PLs and 3rd party data providers.
We are looking for data scientists who will:
Run Leaf’s internal engine to process incoming data and turn these into meaningful insights for our internal teams and customers
Identify and quantify business value applying a diverse set of supply chain improvement levers
Ensure high level of quality of results generated by Leaf’s algorithms
Provide feedback to the rest of the data science and engineering team to ensure continuous improvement of the internal data engine
Build visualizations to clearly communicate results and customer business value
Perform ad-hoc and on-demand analyses for internal stakeholders and customers
Prioritize your time and attention to maximize the impact of limited resources
Who makes a good applied data scientist?
You should be curious, relentless about asking questions until you understand something, and unafraid to acknowledge facts that don’t point in the direction you want them to. Be humble in the face of data, but tenacious in asserting the facts you know.
Be willing to work with people you disagree with; be eager for criticism, and constantly searching for ways to do what you do better. Never be content with things the way they are, but don’t let the quest for something perfect prevent you from shipping something good.
Experience in wider supply chain, especially truckload, is useful. You will need to be experienced with Python, and SQL as well as familiarity with the majority of the following:
Geospatial analysis
Pattern recognition
Clustering
Time series forecasting
Graph-theoretic techniques for network analysis
We’re also a startup, priorities change all the time, something’s always on fire, and there’s twice as much work to do as hands to do it and new challenges surface constantly, and that you will need to be able to manage how you spend your time in the midst of conflicting priorities.

More about Mission Lane:
Mission Lane is based in the U.S., with offices in Richmond, Virginia & San Francisco, California. Founded in December 2018, we've rapidly grown to over 1 million customers.
It all started with a realization: nearly fifty percent of the adult population in the U.S. doesn't have access to a clear line of credit. And by ""clear"" we mean credit without crazy fees that only increase debt. Most traditional credit card companies either overlook or overcharge this group because they have less-than-prime credit scores or no score at all. We decided this just wouldn't do.
We understand that everyone doesn't have the same opportunities. We also know that everyone joins us at different stages of their financial journeys. Providing access to clear credit was a critical first step, but our work isn't done. We are actively developing new products designed to meet our customers where they are, according to their needs.
We get it -
life happens

Just like for our customers, Mission Lane creates opportunities for our employees to learn, grow, and prosper. We strive to create an environment that brings out the best in everyone, everyday.

Leaf is on a mission to upend the way companies buy and sell transportation. Every year, billions of dollars, hundreds of megatons of carbon and millions of person-hours are wasted because the companies who ship goods and the companies who carry them aren’t upfront about their needs and abilities. Our platform finds ways for buyers and sellers to contract binding commitments for plannable and predictable freight and allows those contracts to be traded when needs change. In time, Leaf will become the hub through which the trillion-dollar American freight market is managed.
We are a team of experienced, smart, and mildly disagreeable troublemakers who like taking on unreasonably big challenges; we know how to build things, we’ve lived what’s broken in this industry, and we’re looking for bright, ambitious people to help us drag the transportation world kicking and screaming into the 21st century.
What does an applied data scientist do at Leaf?
We ingest, clean and process large amounts of data from a variety of sources including shippers, carriers, 3PLs and 3rd party data providers.

Build visualizations to clearly communicate results and customer business value
Perform ad-hoc and on-demand analyses for internal stakeholders and customers
Prioritize your time and attention to maximize the impact of limited resources
Who makes a good applied data scientist?
You should be curious, relentless about asking questions until you understand something, and unafraid to acknowledge facts that don’t point in the direction you want them to. Be humble in the face of data, but tenacious in asserting the facts you know.
Be willing to work with people you disagree with; be eager for criticism, and constantly searching for ways to do what you do better. Never be content with things the way they are, but don’t let the quest for something perfect prevent you from shipping something good.
Experience in wider supply chain, especially truckload, is useful. You will need to be experienced with Python, and SQL as well as familiarity with the majority of the following:
Geospatial analysis
Pattern recognition
Clustering
Time series forecasting
Graph-theoretic techniques for network analysis

105,Applied Data Scientist (Remote),Leaf Logistics,,"Remote in New York, NY",,"We are Leaf
Leaf is on a mission to upend the way companies buy and sell transportation. Every year, billions of dollars, hundreds of megatons of carbon and millions of person-hours are wasted because the companies who ship goods and the companies who carry them aren’t upfront about their needs and abilities. Our platform finds ways for buyers and sellers to contract binding commitments for plannable and predictable freight and allows those contracts to be traded when needs change. In time, Leaf will become the hub through which the trillion-dollar American freight market is managed.
We are a team of experienced, smart, and mildly disagreeable troublemakers who like taking on unreasonably big challenges; we know how to build things, we’ve lived what’s broken in this industry, and we’re looking for bright, ambitious people to help us drag the transportation world kicking and screaming into the 21st century.
What does an applied data scientist do at Leaf?
We ingest, clean and process large amounts of data from a variety of sources including shippers, carriers, 3PLs and 3rd party data providers.
We are looking for data scientists who will:
Run Leaf’s internal engine to process incoming data and turn these into meaningful insights for our internal teams and customers
Identify and quantify business value applying a diverse set of supply chain improvement levers
Ensure high level of quality of results generated by Leaf’s algorithms
Provide feedback to the rest of the data science and engineering team to ensure continuous improvement of the internal data engine
Build visualizations to clearly communicate results and customer business value
Perform ad-hoc and on-demand analyses for internal stakeholders and customers
Prioritize your time and attention to maximize the impact of limited resources
Who makes a good applied data scientist?
You should be curious, relentless about asking questions until you understand something, and unafraid to acknowledge facts that don’t point in the direction you want them to. Be humble in the face of data, but tenacious in asserting the facts you know.
Be willing to work with people you disagree with; be eager for criticism, and constantly searching for ways to do what you do better. Never be content with things the way they are, but don’t let the quest for something perfect prevent you from shipping something good.
Experience in wider supply chain, especially truckload, is useful. You will need to be experienced with Python, and SQL as well as familiarity with the majority of the following:
Geospatial analysis
Pattern recognition
Clustering
Time series forecasting
Graph-theoretic techniques for network analysis
We’re also a startup, priorities change all the time, something’s always on fire, and there’s twice as much work to do as hands to do it and new challenges surface constantly, and that you will need to be able to manage how you spend your time in the midst of conflicting priorities.

Join us and make a difference every day.
MSK requires all new hires, volunteers, and vendors who come onsite to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination. This is based on the COVID-19 vaccines’ high level of protection and our shared responsibility in protecting our patients.
Beginning on February 21, 2022, MSK will require all new hires, volunteers, and vendors who come onsite to provide proof of complete COVID-19 vaccination series + booster (once eligible). Individuals currently eligible for a COVID-19 booster
must
get their booster, or have an approved exemption as a condition of employment at MSK. Individuals can get their COVID-19 booster 5 months after receiving their second dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, or 2 months after the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Individuals who are not yet eligible for a booster must meet this criteria within 30 days of becoming eligible.

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Beginning on February 21, 2022, MSK will require all new hires, volunteers, and vendors who come onsite to provide proof of complete COVID-19 vaccination series + booster (once eligible). Individuals currently eligible for a COVID-19 booster
must
get their booster, or have an approved exemption as a condition of employment at MSK. Individuals can get their COVID-19 booster 5 months after receiving their second dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, or 2 months after the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Individuals who are not yet eligible for a booster must meet this criteria within 30 days of becoming eligible.

Several institutional manual curation efforts are underway to fill this need. However, it is infeasible for these efforts to update clinical data in real time, considerable resources are required to be deployed on a large cohort. We are therefore developing NLP infrastructure for automated abstraction of clinical data from EHR.
